<h3> About Me </h3>

<p>
Hi, my name is Mohana Datta Yelugoti(ymdatta), and I'm currently a second-year
undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href =
"https://www.iiitb.ac.in/"> IIIT Bangalore</a>. I like tinkering around with 
computers and low-level programming, and writing scripts.</p>

<p>Few areas I enjoy learning more about and working on (at least till now!):
Computer Architecture, Image Processing, Linear Algebra and C programming.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href = "https://github.com/ymdatta"> Github.</a> Feel
free to contact ymdatta at protonmail dot com</p>
